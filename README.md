# Donation Tracker DApp

## Project Description
The Donation Tracker DApp is a decentralized application built on blockchain technology that enables transparent tracking of donations. It allows donors to contribute funds to causes while providing complete visibility into donation history. Each donation is recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable record that ensures transparency and builds trust between donors and fund recipients.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize charitable giving through blockchain technology by addressing the critical issues of transparency and accountability in the donation process.
